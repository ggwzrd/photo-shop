# Codaisseur-shop

## This is our readme. There are many like it, but this one is ours.
## Our readme is our best friend. It is our life. We must master it as we must master our lives.
## Without us, our readme is useless. Without our readme, we are useless. We must write our readme true. We must code straighter than our enemy who is trying to steal our code without giving credits. We must make him read this before he does.
## Our readme and us know that what counts in coding is not the code we write, the quality of our code, nor the typos we make. We know that it is the UX that counts. We will have good UX...
## Our readme is human, even as us, because it is our life. Thus, we will learn it as a brother. We will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its file format and its syntax. We will keep our readme clean and ready, even as we are clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will...
## Before Linus Torvalds, we swear this creed. Our readme and us are the defenders of our code base. We are the masters of our syntax errors. We are the saviors of our source code.
## So be it, until victory is open-source.
